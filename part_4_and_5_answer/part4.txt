1. Firestore Query
With the userScore field calculated and saved in every document (recalculated upon any modification in ratings, rents, or activity)
2.  Keeping 'recentlyActive' Current
In order to keep the recentlyActive field always current:
Client-Side: Refresh the field with the current epoch time whenever the user takes a significant action (e.g., login or interaction with important features).
Server-Side (Recommended): Utilize Firebase Cloud Functions invoked by specific user activity events to update recentlyActive securely and reliably.
