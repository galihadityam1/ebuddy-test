1. The most difficult problem that I have faced was implementing a real-time chat and notification system using Socket.io while ensuring scalability and performance. The main issues were maintaining stable connections, handling reconnections, and preventing excessive server load. To solve this, I used Redis Pub/Sub to distribute WebSocket events across multiple instances, preventing bottlenecks. I also implemented heartbeat pings to detect inactive users and free up resources efficiently. Additionally, I optimized event broadcasting by ensuring messages were sent only to relevant users instead of all connected clients, reducing unnecessary traffic. Lastly, I added rate limiting to prevent spam and abuse, ensuring smooth real-time interactions even under high traffic
2. I slice the task into sub-task then I work it one by one. Usually I use chatgpt to breakdown the task
3. When I'm learning anything new, I start with fundamentals before diving into comprehensive advanced materials. I find hands-on experience extremely essential, so I develop small projects, experiment, or play with others' code to see how things work. To get a complete overview, I learn from multiple sources, for example, official documentation, YouTube tutorials, online courses, and blogs. Explaining or teaching the concepts to another person also helps to reinforce my own learning, as I am forced to simplify complex ideas. I break up large topics into small, bite-sized pieces and address one at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Applying my knowledge to practical, real-world projects also cements my grasp of the material, as I am able to debug and figure out practical problems. Finally, I continuously revise and re-visit challenging ideas, taking notes to recap major points so that I can retain and use the information properly in the future
4. I choose consistency. Because if u are consistent in everything you work on it, the result will come with your hard work
5. Yes. I am using Macbook, Ipad, and Iphone
6. As soon as possible
